# machine_learning_portfolio
Initially this was going to be a portfolio of works that demonstrate skills in python for some basic machine learning tasks, however after starting work on it, I've found it is much more interesting and fun to create works that show a deeper knowledge of algorithms. Within the samples I present some popular ML methods through demonstrating the mathematics and implementation of this math in python and Mathematica using some of the most popular ML packages available today (scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, etc), enjoy!  

Note: the notebooks render best when viewed in a Jupyter notebook session.

* Another Housing Regression Task: Retrieving, Cleaning, Engineering, Modeling, Tuning & Testing 
* Reinforcement Learning: Value functions, Action-State functions, DQN and All That  
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo: How does it work?
* Linear Models and the Gory Details
* Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation in Neural Networks with Tensorflow
