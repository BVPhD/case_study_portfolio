# machine_learning_portfolio
Initially this was going to be a portfolio of works that demonstrate skills in python for some basic machine learning tasks, however after starting work on it, I've found it is much more interesting and fun to create works that show a deeper understanding of algorithms and shows a pattern of deeper understanding than just being able to copy works which have been done before! So here I now present some works that are some of the basics and some detailed explanations of some popular ML methods enjoy!

* Another Housing Regression Task...In California!
* Reinforcement Learning: Value functions, Action-State functions, DQN and all that  
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo: How does it work?
