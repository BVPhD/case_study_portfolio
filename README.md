# machine_learning_portfolio
Initially this was going to be a portfolio of works that demonstrate skills in python for some basic machine learning tasks, however after starting work on it, I've found it is much more interesting and fun to create works that show a deeper knowledge of algorithms. Within the samples I review some popular ML methods through demonstration and discussion of the theory and  implementation in python and Mathematica.  I make use some of the most popular ML packages available today (scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, etc), and do not review their implementation. enjoy!  

Note: the notebooks render best when viewed in a Jupyter notebook session.
